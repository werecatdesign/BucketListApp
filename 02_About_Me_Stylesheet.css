/* FELLOW WEB ARTISTS PLEASE READ: In this stylesheet, sizes are expressed in their fraction of the viewheight (where 100vh is a 100% of the screen view height) and viewwidth (where 100vw is a 100% of the screen view width). This allows for the design to be responsive to any screen. Please test the screens of the pages that you write anyway. If it doesn't look good, you might choose to use a media query instead.*/
